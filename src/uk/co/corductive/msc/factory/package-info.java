/**
 * The factory package deals with creating the objects that are to be placed on the
 * diagram.
 * 
 * In many instances, component parts must be created and also be given the correct
 * initial positions. Some of the methods will require you to provide the graph that
 * you wish the newly created objects to be added to - this greatly simplifies matters
 * as new objects can come from user creation, copy operations, and file loading; all
 * necessary steps are kept in one place.
