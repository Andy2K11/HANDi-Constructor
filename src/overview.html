            <p>This documentation gives a rough guide to how the program works and gives
            hints to the architectural design which was intended.</p>
            <p>While many design patterns have been used, their late adoption in the 
            development of the program has meant that there are a few inconsistencies
             with their implementation.</p>
            <p>A good place to start may be with the mvc package and also the interfaces 
                in the network.node and network.connection packages</p>

            <p>The non-abstract classes on the bottom level of the UML diagram are the HANDi 
            concrete classes. In theory other types of diagram could be constructed using the 
            same abstract classes and user interface by implementing different interfaces.</p>
